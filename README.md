# Picky Picker!  The Printable Pick and Place Machine

## Overview

What is this?  A pick and place machine is a type of automated equipment widely used in the manufacturing industry. It is designed to pick up components and place them accurately onto a target surface, such as a PCB (Printed Circuit Board). This technology significantly improves production efficiency and precision.  Why this one?  It fits on a desktop, it's 3D printable and inexpensive.

## How It Works

1. **Component Feeding**: Components are fed into the machine using reels in passive feeders
2. **Pick-Up**: A robotic arm with a vacuum or gripper picks up the component.
3. **Alignment**: The machine aligns the component using vision systems.
4. **Placement**: The component is accurately placed onto the target surface.

Yep, this is some boiler plate from ChatGPT.
